Climate change has likely led to the decline of some of Scotland's mountain plants, according to new research. 



Scientists said many of the species relied on snow cover remaining high on hills until late spring and even summer to ensure a moist environment. 



They also said plants that thrived on lower ground in warmer conditions were spreading to mountain habitats. 



Species found to be in decline include snow pearlwort, alpine lady-fern and alpine speedwell. 



The research by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) has taken 20 years to complete and has been published in the new Plant Atlas. 



Data used to produce the report included more than three million plant records of 2,555 species collected by hundreds of botanists across Scotland. 



Climate change, habitat loss and the spread of non-native species were found to key threats to the health of British and Irish native plants. 



BSBI said devastating losses of species in Scotland were among the findings. 



Almost the entire British population of snow pearlwort is found on Ben Lawers, but half of the Perthshire mountain's known colonies have disappeared over the last 40 years.
