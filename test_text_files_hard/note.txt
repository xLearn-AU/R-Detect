This example contains a test text that has a high probability of being classified as generated text instead of its ground truth of human written when compared to the human written distribution (power=0.99) with seed_temp=1 and trail_num=1. However, it will have a higher probability if it's being compared with the generated distribution (power=1.00). This motivates us to need relative tests to lower the possibility of classifying someone's work incorrectly.
