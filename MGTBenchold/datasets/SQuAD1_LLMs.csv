Now, please answer the question. ","According to Howard Zinn, going to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience is not necessary for the goal of the protest. The spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail or by evading it, and the goal is to remind the countrymen of injustice. The key point is not to accept jail penitently as an accession to ""the rules"" and to avoid switching suddenly to a spirit of subservience and demeaning the seriousness of the protest.", reminding their countrymen of injustice,"The goal of civil disobedience is to achieve social, political, or economic change through peaceful protests, disobedience, or other non-violent means.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result.

A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.' and the  question is 'What was Ghandi's work called?'. Now, please answer the question. ",Ghandi's work was called Satyagraha., Satyagraha,Gandhi's work was called Satyagraha.,Civil Disobedience was partly inspired and inspired by Percy Shelley's 'Masque of Anarchy'.,Gandhi's work was called Satyagraha., Ghadni's work was called Satyagraha.,"In his work, 'TheMask of Anarchy', Ghandi wrote: ""Let us make an anarchy, let us shake the world. Let us tear the chains that bind us down. Let us break free from the shackles of tyranny.""

Shelley's poem, 'TheMask of Anarchy', was the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. It was written in 1819, following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, and was published in 1820. It was known for its use of vivid imagery and symbolism, and its focus on the idea of rebellion against tyranny and oppression."

This process is known as carotenoid-based color change, and it is a common adaptation of plants to survive the changing seasons.","Carotenoids make leaves change color in the fall because they help dissipate excess energy in the plants. They also help protect the leaves from damage from cold temperatures and high levels of solar radiation. Additionally, they protect the plant from herbivory by pollinators. All of these factors combine to create a natural ""fall color"" for the leaves, which is a mixture of green and yellow.

The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a ""service"" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed ""international medical science"" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.

Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices.

In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the ""endgame"" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood.

Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe.

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would ""considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view"" and labelling would protect consumers ""just as effectively"". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as ""chocolate"". It had to be ""chocolate substitute"". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a ""chocolate substitute"" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.

His writings against the Jews were largely ignored in previous centuries, but his position on the Jews and their lies was revived by Nazi ideology, which ignored other contributing factors in German history.","The passage provides a historical context for the debate on Luther's influence and its relevance to the development of anti-Semitism in the early 20th century.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.

The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden, this includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006, with the silver gallery above, (at the time the ceramics gallery), the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public. The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance, much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic, this north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble & Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting: Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); Titian (painting); thus representing the range of the museums collections, Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum, this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball.

To answer the question of how many kilometers (acres) of the Ecuadorian rainforest is supported, we need to convert the square kilometers into acres. One kilometer is equal to 0.62 miles, so one square kilometer is equal to 62.4 acres (0.62 miles x 0.62 miles).

It prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand, as shown by Stiglitz and Milanovic.","In 2009, Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in favor of global inequality and against local inequality preventing growth. Stiglitz claims that high global inequality hinders growth, and that a reduction in global inequality would increase growth. 

Branko Milanovic argued in 2001 that increased inequality reduces growth, due to a negative correlation between inequality and education. Inequality is a barrier to development in three main ways. First, less prosperous groups tend to save a smaller proportion of their income than the better-off, which reduces their investments and growth prospects. Second, fewer well-off individuals have the educational skills to take advantage of new opportunities, so they are left behind and grow less fast. Third, higher inequality reduces trust and therefore cooperation. High inequality stifles innovation and discovery, for example in scientific fields where scholars with different backgrounds but similar insights must stay relatively ignorant of the advances of their colleagues, reducing the creativity and efficacy of their work.","Inequality prevents growth by limiting aggregate demand, according to economist Joseph Stiglitz's evidence presented in 2009.", Inequality prevents growth by limiting aggregate demand.,"In the context provided, it is stated that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand.

Dr. Thomas Coke, already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in this action. Coke was then ""set apart"" as a superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there. In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria, which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate.

",The passage states that environmental determinism takes two forms: orientalism and tropicality., orientalism and tropicality,Orientalism and tropicality.,"Environmental determinism can be understood in two forms - orientalism and tropicality. In orientalism, certain regions and their inhabitants are stereotyped and identified as a distinct group. These regions are often referred to as primitive, irrational and backwards. The inhabitants of these regions are therefore considered less advanced and, therefore, less deserving of civilisation, independence and rights. Examples of regions falling under orientalism include the Orient, Africa and pre-Columbian America. 

In tropicality, certain climates are categorised as less civilised and primitive. These less civilised climates are often referred to as ""tropics"". The implication of tropicality is that the ""less civilised"" inhabitants of these climates are less evolved and, therefore, less deserving of rights. Tropicality is present in the European colonisation of Africa. Colonisation of Africa was justified through the theory of environmental determinism. The theory suggested that people in ""tropics"" would be ""less civilized"" and therefore unworthy of self determination and independence. The inherent racism of the theory was highlighted by its discriminatory impact.

Mote believes that the usage of the term'social classes' for the Yuan system of classes is misleading. Instead of the term'social classes', Mote suggests using 'Yuan classes' as a more appropriate term, since it truly represents the social power and wealth of the Chinese people, and people's actual social position within the classes is not determined by their class position but only by 'degrees of privilege' which they are entitled. So a person's class position within the Yuan classes does not guarantee that person's social standing. On the contrary, there are rich and well socially standing Chinese while there are less rich Mongol and Semu than there are Mongol and Semu who live in poverty. 

In summary, Mote agrees with the term'social classes', but believes that 'Yuan classes' is a more accurate term to use in describing the Yuan system of classes.","Mote thought that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth, but just entailed ""degrees of privilege"" to which they were entitled institutionally and legally, so a person's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing."," Mote believed that the Yuan class system was not an accurate representation of social power and wealth, as it was not based on actual social standing or wealth. Instead, it was based on degrees of privilege that were legally and institutionally granted to certain groups. Therefore, a person's standing within the classes was not guaranteed, as there were both rich and well-standing Chinese, as well as less wealthy Mongol and Semu who were treated poorly.","Mote believed that the Yuan class system represented the social hierarchy of the time, which he believed was similar to the modern Western concept of ""social classes"" in the sense that the rich and powerful held positions of authority and the poor and powerless were relegated to the lower rungs of the social hierarchy."

The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced.

On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate.

572a18a4af94a219006aa7df,Economic_inequality,"Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality.

It was shortly appropriated by supporters of ""imperialism"" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians.

Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.' and the  question is 'Are ctenophores predators, vegetarian or parasitic?'.

Most of the ctenophores are predators that include Cylindrobrachia, Pleurobrachia, Epmeiocestrina, Acindrostremma and Ctenopelmatus. Epmeiocestrina is even parasitic to other ctenophores. Cylindrobrachia and Pleurobrachia have been considered as vegetarian ctenophores. The question does not mention Lampea which is a ctenophore of the genus Pleurobrachia and only predators Bolinopsis and other lobate ctenophores.",Ctenophores are predators.," Ctenophores are predators, carnivorous and predatory. They have a wide range of techniques for capturing prey, including hanging motionless in the water using their tentacles as ""web"" and ambush predators like Saltiids jumping spiders. Some ctenophores even use sticky droplets at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. The variety of body forms in a phylum with rather few species is due to the wide range of techniques used by ctenophores for capturing prey.",Ctenophores are predators.

Nozick argues that the ideal moral society is one where all individuals are free from force, but that force is necessary to correct certain modern economic inequalities that have been the result of forceful taking of property. Rawls argues that even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism, and that the greatest moral justification for a strong welfare state is that it can provide for the welfare of all citizens, regardless of their economic status."

It instead discusses some factors that may contribute to civil disobedients deciding whether or not to talk to police officers during an arrest, including a belief that talking to investigators is generally unhelpful and may be harmful, a lack of understanding of legal ramifications, and a desire to make an impression on officers."," Some people purposely resist officers of the law because they believe that their actions are justified and necessary to protect themselves or others from harm. They may also feel a sense of duty to stand up against injustice or oppression. Additionally, some people may feel a sense of pride or personal responsibility in standing up for what they believe is right, even if it means going against the law. However, resistance to officers of the law can also be a form of self-harm or an attempt to control others, and it is important for individuals who engage in civil disobedience to consider the potential consequences and weigh their actions carefully.","In the passage, ""Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases.""

For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade.

",Etioplasts lack chlorophyll but have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stored., yellow chlorophyll precursor,etioplasts have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked.,"Etioplasts have a less well-known, but quite similar structure to chloroplasts. Instead of having their own photosynthetic pigment, they have an endocorrinlagenous membrane in the thylakoid layers of the prolamellar body that resembles a membrane of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. In that membrane there are stacks of endoplasmic reticulum, which resembles the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts also contain another protein called phycobilin, which is what absorbs the red to blue portion of the light used by plants to create energy. Etioplasts have a complete complement of phycobilins, but the presence of endocorrinlagenous membrane means that these are bound to a lipid that is similar to phycocyanin, the purple phycobilins in which plants use to create energy.",Etioplasts have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked instead of chlorophyll., Etioplasts have a yellow chlorophyl precursor stocked.,"If angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts.

","The number of Huguenots killed during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre is estimated to be between 5,000 to 30,000."," 5,000 to 30,000","The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre was a large scale persecution of Huguenots by the Catholic Church in France, during which time up to 30,000 Huguenots were killed.","The Huguenots were a religious group in France that had splintered off from the Roman Catholic Church, hence they are generally referred to as the ""Protestant"" or ""Calvinist"" Church in English-language sources. Their aim was to establish an independent church in the south of France that rejected papal authority. Under the French monarchs Charles IX, Henri III, and Louis XIII, the French Catholic Church waged a number of purges against it in order to root out its former adherents. Some Huguenots were killed during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572) which took place when the Catholic Church's assassins mistakenly believed that they were killing Huguenots. This resulted in the deaths of 5,000 to 30,000. It was a kind of revenge for the thousands of Huguenots that had been killed during the French Catholic Church's Wars of Religion against the Roman Catholic Church from 1562 to 1572.

It should also be noted that there were underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France.","The number of Huguenots killed during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre was between 5,000 to 30,000.", The passage states that the Hugueno,"During the Huguenot purge, which lasted from 1685 to 1715, some members of the Catholic Church in France were either killed or forced into hiding. The exact number is not clear, but it is estimated that around 3,000 Huguenots were killed or executed. The Huguenots were generally opposed to the French Catholic Church, which was seen as a threat to their beliefs. The Huguenots were mostly Protestant and were opposed to the Catholic Church's authority in France. The Huguenots were mostly Protestant, and this division was reflected in their actions during the purge. The Huguenots were also known for their attacks"

The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast. Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes. For these reasons, glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants.' and the  question is 'What kind of organism is Cyanophora?'.

Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force, for example friction.' and the  question is 'What force acted on bodies to retard their velocity?'. Now, please answer the question. ",The force that acted on bodies to retard their velocity according to the passage is friction., friction,The force acted on bodies to retard their velocity was friction.,"Galileo Galilei introduced the concept of force of impetus in the late medieval era. This is an innate force that acts on an object in motion in such a manner that it causes the object to slow down. For example, suppose a stone is rolling down an incline. As the stone descends further, air that is inside the hill becomes thinner. At the same time, as the stone enters the valley floor air gets thicker. When the stone leaves the top of the hill, the air that was thinner on the top of the hill gets closer and closer and thus begins to take in the heat and other elements of the stone. As the air gets closer to the stone, it heats up and the adjacent air starts getting thinner. The stone hits the hill top and the air that was thinner gets in closer contact with the heated stone and hence begins to take in heat and loses its thinness. As a result the stone loses speed and starts to decelerate. What causes the stone to lose speed is that the motion of the stone is not proportional to the decrease in air thickness as a result of air losing its fluidity due to heat transfer. This is because the motion of the stone is not proportional to its weight. So the stone loses speed due to",The force that acted on bodies to retard their velocity was friction., The force that acted on the bodies to retard their velocity was friction.,"The passage is discussing the shortcomings of Aristotelian physics and the influence of Galileo Galilei's work on the development of the scientific method and understanding of motion. Galileo Galilei is credited with being the first scientist to propose that the Earth has a natural force of gravity that causes objects to fall to the ground. He also proposed the idea of the lever and the law of the lever, which helped to explain how objects can be moved in the absence of force. Additionally, he proposed that the acceleration of objects is due to a force acting on them, which is known as the force of acceleration. This idea helped to explain the behavior"

572658daf1498d1400e8dcad,Ctenophora,"The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (""little tentacles""), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.",What are colloblasts?,"{'text': ['specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis', 'specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis', 'specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis'], 'answer_start': [297, 297, 297]}","I will provide a passage and a question to you. The answer should be extracted from the context. You need to return me your answer. The passage is 'The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (""little tentacles""), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey.
