"From 2016 to 2018, this study summarizes the sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area, providing descriptions, historical background, and details on how each fishery is managed. It also includes performance and escapement data for the years 2016–2018. According to the report, reductions in the number and size of fish stocked in local lakes have negatively impacted the popularity and productivity of these fisheries. As this source provides statistical data, it is considered reliable and will be highly valuable to the study, as official data must be taken into account.

The sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area are also discussed in this study. It includes an overview of each fishery, management practices, and fishery performance and escapement data from 2016 to 2018. This report is issued by the official department responsible for regulating fishing activities in Alaska, and since it provides statistical information, it can be trusted as a reliable source. The data will be essential for the research, as incorporating official data is crucial.

A case study is presented on the complexity of factors that either limit or promote diversity in Alaskan fisheries, one of the world’s most significant fishing regions. This study examines changes in participation and portfolio diversity in Alaskan fisheries over three decades, using a combination of harvest data and literature reviews. Four case studies explore how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to interconnected challenges such as biological declines, market dynamics, pricing, and the privatization of fisheries. The article has been verified by experts, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the information. It will be valuable for the research, as it reflects current trends and factors influencing sport fishing."
