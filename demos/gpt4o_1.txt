"Robert Putnam argues that the United States has experienced a significant decline in social capital and civil society over the past 25 years. He begins by emphasizing the importance of social capital and civil society in democratic societies. Tocqueville, during his visit to America, observed that “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition are forever forming associations…Nothing, in my view, deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America” (Putnam, 2000, p. 65). While Putnam acknowledges the challenges in fully understanding the importance of countertrends without further research, he concludes that key elements like social trust are eroding at a concerning rate. He explores this erosion in detail and calls for research to investigate these trends further.

Putnam’s work illustrates that social capital in the United States significantly declined after the mid-to-late 1960s due to factors such as generational change, the rise of television, urban sprawl, and increasing demands on people’s time and resources. This decline is linked to various societal issues, including poorer educational outcomes, economic strain, and heightened tensions within and between social groups. Putnam suggests that revitalizing social capital, akin to efforts during the Progressive Era but with modern methods, could be a solution.

Social capital, defined as “connections among individuals’ social networks,” creates norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness, with value comparable to physical and human capital. In Bowling Alone, Putnam details the decline of social capital in contemporary America, examining its causes, consequences, and possible solutions.

Putnam distinguishes between two types of social capital: bonding capital, which binds individuals within a group, and bridging capital, which connects diverse social groups. Inward-facing networks, like ethnic fraternal organizations and country clubs, often cultivate bonding social capital, while outward-facing networks, such as the civil rights movement or youth service organizations, foster bridging capital. Bridging capital is more inclusive, as it brings together people from different social backgrounds.

However, Putnam warns that social capital can also limit freedom and equality. Bonding capital is often easier to create, especially when formed in opposition to others. For oppressed groups, building bridges through social capital is crucial for greater social mobility and fostering generalized norms of reciprocity. Putnam challenges readers to develop new, inclusive forms of social capital that are not yet widely available."
